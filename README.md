# Hendrix-SLTC-Setup-Tool
Using the Hendrix SLTC Setup Tool, users can select a room in the SLTC building at Hendrix College to create an outline of how the room should be setup for an event. Those with administrative access have the ability to view setup submissions, and have access to all relevant information regarding an event and its setup.
